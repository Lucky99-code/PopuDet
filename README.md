#paper title:PopuDet: Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection in Population Graphs via Micro-macro Relationship Construction and Multi-feature Fusion

The article proposes an innovative ASD detection method, PopuDet, which addresses the limitations of existing methods through micro-macro relationship construction and multi-feature fusion, and achieves excellent performance in experiments. The method is innovative in theory, performs outstandingly in experimental validation, and has certain interpretability and potential value in clinical applications.

data pre-processing: The steps included (1) slice timing correction; (2) motion adjustment; (3) skull segmentation; (4) band-pass filtering; (5) 5 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel; and (6) registration in standard anatomical space (MNI152) with resampling to a 4 mm resolution.

We provide all hyperparameter settings for the reproducibility of code:
